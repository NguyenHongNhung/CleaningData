#Component of measurement variables' names:
t or f: Time or Frequency : Type of measurement
Body or Gravity : Force causing signal
Acc or Gyro (Accelerometer or Gyroscope): Instrument makeing measurement
Jerk, Mag: Jerk signal or Magnitude Signals.
mean or std (Mean or StandardDeviation): The value reported is the average or standard deviation
X , Y or Z : Direction of force being measured

#Specifically, there are 66 measurement variables:
